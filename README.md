# About The Project

This is a scala 2.12.8 project to solve chess puzzle


# Problem
The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with
dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number
of results is useful, but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does not
matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.
Write a program which takes as input: 
- The dimensions of the board: M, N
- The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

# 7×7 board with 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Bishops and 1 Knight
- **Time** is 38.481887419 seconds
- **Total number of solutions** is 3063828 solution
